# Description
#
#     This script creates one ISO image of the client directory per
#     run. The included downloads can be restricted with a series of
#     ExcludeListISO-*.txt files.
#
#     The script requires either mkisofs or genisoimage, depending on
#     the distribution:
#
#     - mkisofs is the original tool and preferred. It is part of the
#       cdrtools, which use a Solaris-style license. This seems to
#       restrict the distribution of binary packages, but not that of
#       source packages. Therefore, (only) Linux distributions like
#       Gentoo, which use source packages, may still provide mkisofs
#       and the other cdrtools.
#
#     - genisoimage and cdrkit are forks, which were created after the
#       license change for the cdrtools. They are provided by most other
#       Linux distributions like Debian and Fedora.

#   w100-x64      Windows 10 / Server 2016, 64-bit  (current version only)
#
# The options are:
#
#   -includesp         Include service packs
#   -includecpp        Include Visual C++ Runtime Libraries
#   -includedotnet     Include .NET Frameworks
#   -includewddefs     Include Windows Defender virus definitions for
#                      the built-in Defender of Windows Vista and 7.
#   -includemsse       Include Microsoft Security Essentials. The virus
#                      definitions are also used for the built-in Defender
#                      of Windows 8, 8.1 and 10.
#   -output-path <dir> Output directory for the ISO image file
#   -create-hashes     Create a hashes file for the ISO image file
#
# The script create-iso-image.bash is meant to support both the current
# and the ESR version of WSUS Offline Update, but some updates are only
# available in the current version and vice versa.
#
# The distinction is the presence of the filter files ExcludeListISO-*.txt
# and the download directories: Windows XP is not supported by the current
# version, because neither the filter file ExcludeListISO-wxp.txt nor
# the download directory client/wxp can be found. The profile "all",
# which only removes three unneeded files, can be used with the ESR
# version, though.
#
#
# The script create-iso-image.bash has basically three modes of operation:
#
# 1. The profile "all" creates one ISO image of the whole client
#    directory. It is left to the user, to restrict the resulting ISO
#    image to a reasonable size.
#
# 2. The profiles "all-x86" and "all-win-x64" create two ISO images,
#    one per architecture. These are the 'X86-cross-product' ISO images
#    of the Windows application UpdateGenerator.exe.
#
#    Originally, these ISO images were supposed to fit on DVD-5 optical
#    disks, and the file size should be restricted to 4.7 GB, but today
#    they may easily get larger.
#
# 3. The profiles "w60", "w60-x64", etc create a series of ISO images
#    per product.
#
#    Originally, these ISO images were supposed to fit on CD-ROMs, and
#    the file size should be restricted to 700 MB. Again, the resulting
#    ISO images may easily get larger than that.
#
#    These size restrictions may explain, though, why large installers
#    are sometimes excluded from the created ISO images.
#
# The distinction "per selected language" is not used anymore. It was
# useful for localized Windows updates, e.g. for Windows XP and Windows
# Server 2003, but all supported Windows versions in the current version
# of WSUS Offline Update use global/multilingual updates.
#
# Most Office updates will be in the ofc/glb directory, and a filter
# per language will not make a big difference.
#
#
# The Linux script create-iso-images.bash uses its own filter files in
# the sh/exclude directory. These files are based of the files in the
# WSUS Offline Update directory wsusoffline/exclude, but the syntax has
# been reviewed: Many shell pattern seem to be unneeded. For example,
# the directory ofc can be excluded with just the name ofc. Adding shell
# pattern around the name only creates ambiguities. The syntax seems
# to be slightly different on Windows and Linux, although basically the
# same tools (mkisofs and genisoimage) are used.
#
# The file About_the_ExcludeListISO-files.txt in the directory sh/exclude
# explains the translation of the ExcludeListISO-*.txt files from Windows
# to Linux.
#
# User may create local copies of the ExcludeListISO-*.txt files in the
# directory ./exclude/local. These local copies replace the supplied
# files. This is different from the handling of custom files by WSUS
# Offline Update, but it is more the Linux way, and it allows to both
# add and remove filter lines.
#
#
# The created ISO images have filenames like
# 2019-04-14_wsusoffline-11.6.2_all.iso. These are composed of:
#
# 1. The build date from the file wsusoffline/client/builddate.txt,
#    which indicates the last run of the download script
# 2. The name wsusoffline
# 3. The WSUS Offline Update version
# 4. The used profile
