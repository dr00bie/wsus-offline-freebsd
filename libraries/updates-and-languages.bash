# Description
#
#     This file defines menus and tables for the updates, languages and
#     available options.
#
#     Menus and tables basically provide the same information, but in a
#     different format: menus are indexed arrays, while tables are text
#     variables with multiple lines.
#
#
#     Menus for the script update-generator.bash
#
#     Menus are implemented as indexed arrays. They are used to create
#     simple selection dialogs with the bash built-in command "select".
#
#     Each array element consists of a name and description. It can be
#     split into single fields with "read -r". As usual with "read",
#     the last variable receives the remainder of the line. This is
#     used here to split the line into two fields, without needing any
#     additional field delimiters like commas or semicolons:
#
#     read -r update_name   update_description   <<< "${line}"
#     read -r language_name language_description <<< "${line}"
#     read -r option_name   option_description   <<< "${line}"
#
#
#     Tables for the script download-updates.bash
#
#     Tables are created by printing the indexed arrays. They can be
#     searched just like text files, by replacing a file reference with
#     a "here-string". The function name_to_description reads the table
#     in a loop and returns the description, if the specified name was
#     found. The similar function language_name_to_locale returns the
#     locale for a given language name.
