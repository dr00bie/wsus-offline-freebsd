# Description
#
#     This task calculates superseded updates. The current implementation
#     for both Windows and Linux is depicted in a forum article:
#
#     https://forums.wsusoffline.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=5676
#
#     One remaining problem with this implementation is, that superseded
#     updates may be missing, if the superseding updates are excluded
#     from download.
#
#     This is an old problem, which was first found with Windows XP:
#     The desktop versions of Windows XP are not officially supported
#     anymore, but the embedded Windows XP POSready still is. Updates for
#     the embedded Windows XP would replace (and supersede) older updates
#     for the desktop versions. The newer updates cannot be installed,
#     but the older updates are now missing. This can be solved by adding
#     the missing updates to the file ExcludeList-superseded-exclude.txt,
#     but this only works in retrospect.
#
#     A revised method for the calculation of superseded updates was
#     first suggested in a forum article, to help with the problem,
#     that full quality update rollups superseded security-only updates
#     (but only for the first month). If quality update rollups were
#     excluded from download, then security-only updates would still
#     be treated as superseded. Without any workaround, they would be
#     missing in the download.
#
#     http://forums.wsusoffline.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=6141
#
#     Version 1.0-beta-1 of the Linux download scripts (the initial
#     release) already included an experimental implementation of this
#     method in the subdirectory available-tasks.
#
#     But the problem was solved differently at the time, by introducing
#     new configuration files in the exclude, client/static and
#     client/exclude directories. The revised method also needed an
#     "initial block list" of excluded updates to start with, and it
#     was not quite clear, how to create this list.
#
#     But now we can use the file HideList-seconly.txt as input, to
#     automatically correct the list of superseded updates for updates,
#     which are superseded by the full quality update rollups, but not
#     by the security-only updates.
#
#     In the meantime, Microsoft removed the dependencies between quality
#     update rollups and security-only updates after just one month:
#
#     "UPDATED 12/5/2016: Starting in December 2016, monthly rollups
#     will not supersede security only updates. The November 2016 monthly
#     rollup will also be updated to not supersede security only updates."
#     -- https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Blog-Archive/More-on-Windows-7-and-Windows-8-1-servicing-changes/ba-p/166783
#
#     So maybe the initial problem doesn't really exist anymore.
#
#     But in rare cases, there are still updates reported as missing. It
#     seems, that the quality update rollups sometimes include (and
#     supersede) older updates, while the security-only updates only
#     include new updates for the current month. Then again, such updates
#     would be missing, if security-only updates are selected.
#
#     In two cases, the revised method could automatically recover
#     the missing updates. Therefore, it may still be useful to have a
#     working implementation of this method around.
